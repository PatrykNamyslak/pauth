# PHP Auth

Simple Auth solution in PHP using PDO & MySQL.

Are you tired of having to make an auth for a small simple project? Me too! So I just went ahead and made this reusable and modular php auth solution, this is not meant for production level projects but for small personal projects that don't shine the spotlight on the auth process.
