# PHP Auth

Simple Auth solution in PHP using PDO & MySQL.

Are you tired of having to make an auth for a small and simple project? So am I! So I just went ahead and made this reusable and modular php auth solution with database structure/ sql code you can import to your [phpmyadmin](https://www.phpmyadmin.net/) or [Adminer](https://www.adminer.org/en/) installation and integrate that with your php code, this is not meant for production level projects but for small personal projects that don't shine the spotlight on the auth process.
